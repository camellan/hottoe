Description: Suka Hottoe Sound Controller
 Suka Hottoe is a simple Elementary based volume  control tool
 (mixer).In contrast to classic mixer tools this one allows
 you to control both the volume of hardware devices and of
 each playback stream separately. It also allows you to redirect
 a playback stream to another output device without interrupting
 playback.
